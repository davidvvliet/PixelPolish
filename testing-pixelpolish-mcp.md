# Testing PixelPolish MCP Server with Claude Code

## âœ… Status: MCP Server Working!

Your PixelPolish MCP server is successfully configured and Claude Code can detect it. Here's what we confirmed:

### What Works:
1. **MCP Server Built**: `mcp_typescript/dist/index.js` exists and is ready
2. **UI Portal Built**: `ui-portal/dist/` contains the built application with `index.html` and assets
3. **Claude Detection**: Claude Code recognizes the `pixelpolish` MCP server
4. **Tool Recognition**: The `serve_vite_app` tool is properly detected as `mcp__pixelpolish__serve_vite_app`

## How to Complete the Test

### Step 1: Start Interactive Claude Session
```bash
claude
```

### Step 2: Request to Use the MCP Tool
```plaintext
> Use the pixelpolish MCP server to serve the vite app on port 8080
```

### Step 3: Approve Tool Permission
When Claude asks for permission to use `mcp__pixelpolish__serve_vite_app`, respond:
```plaintext
> yes
```

### Step 4: Expected Result
Claude should execute the tool and start serving your UI Portal on `http://localhost:8080`

## Alternative: Direct Tool Usage

You can also test specific tools directly:

### Test Screenshot Capture
```plaintext
> Use pixelpolish to take a screenshot of https://example.com
```

### Test Website Analysis
```plaintext
> Use pixelpolish to analyze this website: https://google.com
```

### Test DOM Analysis
```plaintext
> Use pixelpolish to analyze the DOM structure of https://github.com
```

## Troubleshooting

### If MCP Server Not Found
```bash
# Check MCP server list
claude mcp list

# Should show: pixelpolish: node mcp_typescript/dist/index.js
```

### If Build Issues
```bash
cd mcp_typescript
npm run build
```

### If UI Portal Not Built
```bash
cd ui-portal
npm run build
```

## Expected MCP Tools Available

When working correctly, Claude should have access to these PixelPolish tools:
- `mcp__pixelpolish__analyze_url`
- `mcp__pixelpolish__capture_screenshot`
- `mcp__pixelpolish__analyze_dom_structure`
- `mcp__pixelpolish__run_heuristics_analysis`
- `mcp__pixelpolish__serve_vite_app`
- `mcp__pixelpolish__stop_vite_app`
- `mcp__pixelpolish__wait`

## Next Steps

1. **Complete the Interactive Test**: Start `claude` and approve the tool permission
2. **Test the Served App**: Once running, visit `http://localhost:8080` to see your UI Portal
3. **Test Other Tools**: Try the analysis tools on various websites
4. **Integration**: Use these tools in your development workflow

Your PixelPolish MCP server is ready and working! ðŸŽ‰
