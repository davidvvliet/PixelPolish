    # UI Analysis Guidelines

    ## Best Practices for UI Description:
    - Be detailed and specific about layout, colors, components
    - Describe user interactions and flows
    - Mention any specific functionality or features
    - Include information about target users/use cases
    - Note any existing problems you've observed

    ## Analysis Focus Areas:
    - **General**: Comprehensive overview of all aspects
    - **Accessibility**: WCAG compliance, screen reader compatibility
    - **Usability**: User flow, navigation, cognitive load
    - **Design**: Visual hierarchy, consistency, branding
    - **Mobile**: Responsive design, touch targets, mobile UX

    ## Common Issues to Look For:
    - Poor color contrast
    - Inconsistent spacing and typography
    - Unclear navigation
    - Missing feedback states
    - Accessibility violations
    - Mobile responsiveness problems

    ## Implementation Tips:
    - Prioritize high-severity issues first
    - Test fixes with real users when possible
    - Maintain design system consistency
    - Consider performance implications

    ## Example UI Description:
    "A login form with email and password fields, a blue submit button, 
    and a 'Forgot Password?' link below. The form is centered on a white 
    background with the company logo at the top. There's no validation 
    feedback shown and the button text is very small."
