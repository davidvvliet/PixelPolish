### `capture_screenshot`
Take high-quality screenshots of any URL using Playwright.

**Parameters:**
- `url` (required): URL to screenshot
- `filename` (optional): Custom filename (default: 'screenshot')

### `analyze_dom_structure`
Extract and analyze DOM structure, including headings, navigation, forms, images, and links.

**Parameters:**
- `url` (required): URL to analyze

### `run_heuristics_analysis`
Run comprehensive 190-point heuristics analysis across 6 rule categories.

**Parameters:**
- `url` (required): URL to analyze

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Services
- **DOM Capture** - Puppeteer-based element extraction with computed styles
- **CSS Extractor** - Layout, spacing, typography, and color analysis
- **Heuristics Engine** - 190-point scoring system with 6 rule categories
- **Screenshot Service** - Playwright visual capture with cache-busting
- **AI Analyzer** - GPT-4V/Claude integration for visual assessment

### 190-Point Heuristics System
- **Alignment Rule** (40 points) - Grid-based alignment detection
- **Spacing Consistency** (35 points) - Margin/padding pattern analysis
- **Typography Consistency** (30 points) - Font usage and hierarchy
- **Accessibility Rule** (35 points) - Alt text, heading hierarchy, structure
- **Responsiveness Rule** (25 points) - Modern layout usage (Flexbox/Grid)
- **Performance Rule** (25 points) - DOM complexity and optimization

## üéØ Usage with AI Assistants

This MCP server is designed to be used by AI assistants. When connected, the assistant gains access to comprehensive UI analysis tools.

**Example workflow:**
1. AI uses `analyze_url` tool to get complete analysis
2. Receives technical scoring, visual assessment, and priority fixes
3. Can drill down with specific tools like `run_heuristics_analysis`
4. Screenshots captured automatically for visual context

## üîê Environment Variables

```bash
# For AI visual analysis (optional)
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...           # For GPT-4 Vision
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...    # For Claude Vision
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

```bash
npm run dev       # Watch mode
npm run build     # Compile TypeScript
npm run clean     # Clean build artifacts
```

## üìä Analysis Output

### Technical Analysis
- DOM structure with element count and hierarchy
- CSS pattern analysis (spacing, typography, colors)
- 190-point heuristics scoring with rule breakdown
- Issue classification by severity (critical, high, medium, low)
- Actionable recommendations

### AI Visual Assessment
- Overall design quality evaluation
- Color harmony and layout balance assessment
- Typography consistency analysis
- Accessibility scoring
- Priority fix recommendations with specific CSS/HTML changes

### Combined Scoring
- Technical Score (60%) + Visual AI Score (40%)
- Comprehensive issue summary
- Priority action items

## üéâ Benefits

- **For AI Assistants**: Provides deep UI analysis capabilities
- **For Developers**: Get actionable feedback on design quality
- **For Design Systems**: Automated consistency checking
- **For Accessibility**: Built-in a11y compliance validation
